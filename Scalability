Scalability is the ability of a system, network, or application to handle an increasing amount of work, users, or data, without compromising performance, reliability, or functionality.

### **Types of Scalability**

1. **Vertical Scalability (Scale Up)**  
   - **Definition**: Increasing the capacity of a single machine (server or node).  
   - **How it's done**: Add more CPU, RAM, storage, or faster hardware to an existing system.
   - **Example**: Upgrading from 16GB RAM to 64GB RAM on the same server.
   - **Pros**:
     - Easier to implement.
     - Less complexity in application architecture.
   - **Cons**:
     - Has a hardware limit (canâ€™t scale infinitely).
     - May lead to a single point of failure.

2. **Horizontal Scalability (Scale Out)**  
   - **Definition**: Adding more machines or nodes to a system to distribute the load.
   - **How it's done**: Deploy more servers or instances and balance the traffic between them.
   - **Example**: Adding 3 more web servers behind a load balancer.
   - **Pros**:
     - More flexible and fault-tolerant.
     - Can handle very large-scale applications.
   - **Cons**:
     - More complex architecture (requires load balancing, distributed systems).
     - Requires careful design of system components (e.g., stateless services, shared databases).
